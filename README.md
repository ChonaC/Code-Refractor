# Code-Refractor

# Description

In this assignment, I had to make changes to the already made program to insure that the site is optimized for search engines.

# CSS & HTML: Comments
-- I took out the .header div ul because in HTML I removed ul because we dont need the list to be bulleted. The tag li is good enough to get the results that is needed. 

-- In HTML, I made sure that the site has a unique title and not just webiste.

-- In HTML, I had to "debug" the first list for the nav because it was not working like the others. Now, when clicking on the "Search Engine Optimization" the page will redirect the user to the correct section of the site.

-- In HTML, I made sure that each image has a unique description by using the alt="". * Some image will just have a name because I could not think of a good description. 

-- In HTML, I changed all of the child containers into id so that the programmer is aware with what is the parent container and which are the child containers. By doing this, I also had to make sure to use the id tag (#) in CSS instead of the class tag (.). 

-- In HTML, the I left the div class tag to content and benefits but changed the inside content to id. By doing this, I also had to make sure that the correct tag is used in CSS.

-- In CSS, some of the information were redundant so I had to shrink a couple elements like instead of ..

.benefit-lead h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}

.benefit-brand h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}

.benefit-cost h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
} 

I changed it to ..

.benefits h3{
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}
